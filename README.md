> ### A resource of spaces around San Francisco.

Each space is selected and displayed in the service of the goal of making community spaces more recognizable, and hopefully, better utilized. A community space is not a strong definition – we have included everything from parks to selected coffee shops to selected publicly open private spaces (POPOs).

### Developing

Clone the repository, install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

### Contributing

To add, edit, or remove spaces from the map, edit `/src/lib/spaces_sf.jsonc`. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for detailed schema and contribution guidelines.

Adding a UI + database is somewhere on the list of priorities but not too high.
