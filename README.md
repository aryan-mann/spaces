> ### A resource of spaces around San Francisco.

Each space is selected and displayed in the service of the goal of making community spaces more recognizable, and hopefully, better utilized. A community space is not a strong definition â€“ we have included everything from parks to selected coffee shops to selected publicly open private spaces (POPOs).

### Developing

Clone the repository, install dependencies and use the `dev` script. For yarn, this would be `yarn && yarn dev`; for pnpm, we would `pnpm install && pnpm dev`; etc.

### Contributing

For now: to add, edit, or remove spaces to the map, open a PR and edit the `spaces.ts` in the `src/lib` directory. Adding a UI + database is somewhere on the list of priorities but not too high.
