        <p>This project is built and maintained by me â€“ Aryan. There are a ton of really cool places around San Francisco that should be on this list but it will take some time. If you love finding cool spots too, you can let me know about them by just sending me an email at:</p>
        <p class="text-xl text-center w-full my-4">aryan.21.mann@gmail.com</p>
        <p>It would be super helpful if that email had:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc">
            <li>Name of the place</li>
            <li>A short description</li>
            <li>Opening hours</li>
            <li>General location (I can figure out the coordinates)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-8">It would be <b>amazing</b> if that email had:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc">
            <li>Some images of the place</li>
            <li>A list of tags (whether it has wifi, how is the seating situation, it is work friendly, etc.)</li>
            <li>Your rating for it out of 5</li>
        </ul>
